# THIS **WILL BREAK YOUR SYSTEM**

roadmap:
- create finishing (20%)
	- print info; will be sparse atm (90%)
	- check secure execution (10%)
	- speed up processes (5%)
- test (15%)
	- download logic (100%)
	- uninstall logic (0%)
	- install logic (0%)
	- patch logic (0%)
	- security (0%)
	- error catch (0%)

-\> sometime in the future an emergency purge script will be available

The most important thing now is testing and bug fixing.  
Since it’s impossible for me to know how many bugs there are I’m just going to list them here and if they’re fixed:
- Deleted System files (not fixed) {THAT IS why I’m NOT UPLOADING the script, this MUST be detected BEFORE reboot, otherwise the system is wrecked}
- Uninstallers don’t do their job
