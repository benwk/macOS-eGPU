# DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH AT ALL!!!!
# THIS **WILL BREAK YOUR SYSTEM**

roadmap:
- test (15%)
	- download logic (100%)
	- uninstall logic (0%)
	- install logic (0%)
	- patch logic (0%)
	- security (0%)
	- error catch (0%)

*The most important thing now is testing and bug fixing.*  
Since it’s impossible for me to know how many bugs there are I’m just going to list them here and if they’re fixed:
- Deleted System files (**not fixed**) **THAT IS why I’m NOT UPLOADING the script, this MUST be detected BEFORE reboot, otherwise the system is wrecked!**
- Uninstallers don’t do their job (**not fixed**)
